# ðŸ§® Array Problems

This folder includes my solutions to fundamental **array problems** from LeetCode â€” each chosen to strengthen core algorithmic reasoning and prepare for technical interviews.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem List

|   | Problem | Description | Time | Space |
|---|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Find two numbers that add up to a target using a hash map. | O(n) | O(n) |
| 53 | [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) | Use Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. | O(n) | O(1) |
| 121 | [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) | Track the minimum stock price to compute the best profit. | O(n) | O(1) |
| 152 | [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/) | Track both max & min product to handle negatives (Java solution). | O(n) | O(1) |
| 238 | [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/) | Compute prefix & suffix products without division. | O(n) | O(1)\* |
| 283 | [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/) | Move all zeros to the end while keeping the order of non-zero elements. | O(n) | O(1) |

\* Excluding output array â€” optimized version uses constant extra space.

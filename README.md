# Algorithm & Data Structure Problems

This repository contains my solutions to algorithm and data structure problems, mostly from **LeetCode**.  
The purpose is to practice problem-solving and build a strong foundation for coding interviews.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `arrays/` â€“ arrays & strings  
- `hashmap/` â€“ hash maps & sets  
- `linked_list/` â€“ singly & doubly linked lists  
- `stack_queue/` â€“ stack, queue, monotonic stack  
- `binary_search/` â€“ binary search techniques  
- `trees/` â€“ binary trees & binary search trees (BST)  
- `graphs/` â€“ graph traversal (BFS, DFS, topological sort)  
- `dynamic_programming/` â€“ DP & optimization problems  
- (folders will be filled step by step)

## ðŸš€ Notes 
- Each file includes:
  - Problem link  
  - Short explanation / approach  
  - Time & Space complexity
